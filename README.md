## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexander â€” a data engineer and software developer focused on building scalable pipelines, AI-powered applications, and cloud-based tools.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: data consultancy work and contributing to hobby FOSS repos in my free time
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  DevOps, GameDev, and more about standard software engineering with C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on: ML pipelines, anything involving data infrastructure, or hobby projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [ahernandezjr0@gmail.com](mailto:ahernandezjr0@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first machine learning model used OpenCV to analyze adversarial images that mess with neural nets (it was a fun introduction!)

Pleasure to meet you!
